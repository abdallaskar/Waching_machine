# Washing Machine Project
This project is a Washing Machine implemented using an AVR microcontroller, LCD, buttons, and motors. The washing machine is designed to provide basic functionalities for washing clothes.

## Hardware Components
The following hardware components are used in this project:

AVR Microcontroller: The microcontroller acts as the brain of the washing machine, controlling its operations and interfacing with other components.

LCD (Liquid Crystal Display): The LCD is used to display information about the washing machine's status, cycle progress, and user instructions.

Buttons: The buttons are used for user input, allowing them to select different washing modes, start/stop the machine, and adjust settings.

Motors: The motors are responsible for spinning the drum, agitating the clothes, and draining water during the washing process.

## Features
The Washing Machine project provides the following features:

Display: The LCD displays relevant information such as the selected washing mode, cycle progress, and any error messages.

Washing Modes: The user can select different washing modes based on their requirements, such as gentle wash, normal wash, or heavy wash.

Cycle Control: The washing machine controls the timing and sequence of operations during a wash cycle, including filling water, agitating clothes, rinsing, and draining water.

User Interaction: The user can interact with the washing machine using the buttons. They can start/stop the machine, select a washing mode, adjust settings, and view the cycle progress.

Error Handling: The washing machine incorporates error handling mechanisms to detect and display any errors or malfunctions, motor failure, or door open.
